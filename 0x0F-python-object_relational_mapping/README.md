# Python Object Relational Mapping
## Object-relational Mappers (ORMs)
An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that
automates the transfer of data stored in relational 
database tables into objects that are more commonly used
in application code.

# TASKS
## 0 Get all states
Write a script that lists all states from the database 
hbtn_0e_0_usa

## 1 Filter states
Write a script that lists all states with a name starting 
with N (upper N) from the database hbtn_0e_0_usa:

## 2 Filter states by user input
Write a script that takes in an argument and displays all 
values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa where name 
matches the argument

## 3 SQL Injection
Once again, write a script that takes in arguments and 
displays all values in the states table of hbtn_0e_0_usa 
where name matches the argument. But this time, write one 
that is safe from MySQL injections!
